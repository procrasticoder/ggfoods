                    <ul>
                      <li>Wheatgrass is one of the best sources of living chlorophyll available.</li>
                      <li>Chlorophyll is the first product of light and, therefore, contains more light energy than any other element</li>
                      <li>Wheatgrass is crude chlorophyll and can be taken orally and as a colon implant without toxic side effects.</li>
                      <li>Chlorophyll is the basis of all plant life.</li>
                      <li>Wheatgrass is high in oxygen like all green plants that contain chlorophyll. The brain and all body tissues function at an optimal level in a highly-oxygenated environment.</li>
                      <li>Chlorophyll is anti-bacterial and can be used inside and outside the body as a healer.</li>
                      <li>Science has proven that chlorophyll arrests growth and development of unfriendly bacteria.</li>
                      <li>Chlorophyll rebuilds the bloodstream. Studies of various animals have shown chlorophyll to be free of any toxic reaction. The red cell count was returned to normal within 4 to 5 days of the administration of chlorophyll, even in those animals which were known to be extremely anemic or low in red cell count</li>
                      <li>Farmers in the Midwest who have sterile cows and bulls put them on wheatgrass to restore fertility. (The high magnesium content in chlorophyll builds enzymes that restore the  hormones.)</li>
                      <li>Chlorophyll can be extracted from many plants, but wheatgrass is superior because it has been found to have over 100 elements needed by man. If grown in organic soil, it absorbs 92 of the known 102 minerals from the soil.</li>
                      <li>Wheatgrass Juice is a superior detoxification agent compared to carrot juice and other fruits and vegetables. Dr Earp-Thomas says that 15 pounds of Wheatgrass is the equivalent of 350 pounds of carrot, lettuce, celery, and so forth.</li>
                      <li>Liquid chlorophyll washes drug deposits from the body.</li>
                      <li>Chlorophyll neutralizes toxins in the body.</li>
                      <li>Chlorophyll helps purify the liver.</li>
                      <li>Chlorophyll improves blood sugar problems.</li>

                      <li>Wheatgrass is crude chlorophyll and can be taken orally and as a colon implant without toxic side effects.</li>
                      <li>Chlorophyll is the basis of all plant life.</li>
                      <li>Wheatgrass is high in oxygen like all green plants that contain chlorophyll. The brain and all body tissues function at an optimal level in a highly-oxygenated environment.</li>
                      <li>Chlorophyll is anti-bacterial and can be used inside and outside the body as a healer.</li>
                      <li>Science has proven that chlorophyll arrests growth and development of unfriendly bacteria.</li>
                      <li>Chlorophyll rebuilds the bloodstream. Studies of various animals have shown chlorophyll to be free of any toxic reaction. The red cell count was returned to normal within 4 to 5 days of the administration of chlorophyll, even in those animals which were known to be extremely anemic or low in red cell count</li>
                      <li>Farmers in the Midwest who have sterile cows and bulls put them on wheatgrass to restore fertility. (The high magnesium content in chlorophyll builds enzymes that restore the  hormones.)</li>
                      <li>Chlorophyll can be extracted from many plants, but wheatgrass is superior because it has been found to have over 100 elements needed by man. If grown in organic soil, it absorbs 92 of the known 102 minerals from the soil.</li>
                      <li>Wheatgrass Juice is a superior detoxification agent compared to carrot juice and other fruits and vegetables. Dr Earp-Thomas says that 15 pounds of Wheatgrass is the equivalent of 350 pounds of carrot, lettuce, celery, and so forth.</li>
                      <li>Liquid chlorophyll washes drug deposits from the body.</li>
                      <li>Chlorophyll neutralizes toxins in the body.</li>
                      <li>Chlorophyll helps purify the liver.</li>
                      <li>Chlorophyll improves blood sugar problems.</li>
